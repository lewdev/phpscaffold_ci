This is just a simple scaffolding app for CodeIgniter derived from:
http://www.phpscaffold.com

I made it to style my tastes so feel free to edit this. The code is massive and I should have separated them into manageable separate files.

In any case, the resulting files is fairly simple since it uses the same form to add and edit.


== Files Generated ==
* model/(table name)_model.php
* controllers/(table name).php
* views/(table name)/(table name)_actions.php
* views/(table name)/(table name)_browse.php
* views/(table name)/(table name)_form.php
* views/(table name)/(table name)_view.php
* views/layout_header.php
* views/layout_footer.php


== Original Readme file ==
Feel free to use this how you like.

Make sure that the /temp/ folder is writeable.
